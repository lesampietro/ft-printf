# ft-printf
The goal of this project is simple: to program my own printf(), by recreating its behaviour without relying on the original implementation, unsing variadic functions. 
>The printf function in C is a standard library function used to print formatted output to the console. It is part of the <stdio.h> header file and provides a versatile way to display data of various types by using format specifiers.
##Usage
```int ft_printf(const char *format, ...);```
