# ft-printf | 42
>Because `ft_putnbr()` & `ft_putsrt()` are not enough.
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is simple: to program my own `printf()`*, by recreating its behaviour without relying on the original implementation.
- _*The printf function in C is a standard library function used to print formatted output to the console. It is part of the <stdio.h> header file and provides a versatile way to display data of various types by using format specifiers._

## Requirements
### ðŸ““ Mandatory
Following the original `printf()`, our version should be able to:
- [x] Accept a format string and a variable number of arguments.
- [x] Handle both plain text and placeholders (format specifiers).
- [x] Output the formatted result to the standard output (stdout).
- [x] Return the total number of characters printed.

And `ft_printf()` should be prototyped as below:
```c
int ft_printf(const char *format, ...);
```

## Usage
An example of how ft_printf might be implemented and used:
```c
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    ft_printf("Hello, World! My favorite number is %d.\n", num);
    return 0;
}
```
Expected Output:
```c
Hello, World! My favorite number is 42.
```
